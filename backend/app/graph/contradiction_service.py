"""Contradiction detection (Task 4.4, real path): embed each new decision,
find similar past decisions from OTHER meetings via ChromaDB, then ask a
judge whether they actually conflict (not just topically similar). On a
real contradiction, returns a Flag for the Phase 5.3 summary response —
and, since 2026-08-15, for live in-call suggestions too (check_text()).

This module only detects — it does not write to Neo4j. The CONTRADICTS edge
needs both Decision nodes to already exist, and this meeting's own decision
nodes aren't created until app.graph.graph_builder.build_from_meeting() runs
(after this check), so app.tasks.meeting_tasks writes the edges once nodes
exist, using each Flag's source_decision_text/contradicts_decision_text.
