"""Regression tests for the /graph and /meeting/{id}/graph-data endpoints:
every link's source/target must correspond to a node actually present in
the same response's nodes array, or react-force-graph-2d's d3-force layer
throws "node not found" and the frontend Memory Graph fails to render.

Each fixture below mocks app.graph.neo4j_service.run_query with a
side_effect list matching the exact, fixed order the endpoint issues its
Cypher queries in. The CONTRADICTS row deliberately references a decision
id ("d2") absent from the earlier decisions-query fixture, reproducing:

  - get_meeting_graph_data: a CONTRADICTS edge always points at "other", a
    Decision that may belong to a different meeting than the one this
    endpoint scopes its own decision-gathering query to — so it's *never*
    in `nodes` unless added explicitly.
  - get_global_graph_data: each Cypher query runs as its own independent
    Neo4j auto-commit transaction (see neo4j_service.run_query), so a
    decision + CONTRADICTS edge committed by a concurrent meeting-processing
    task between the "decisions" query and the "contradicts" query would be
    picked up by the latter but missed by the former.
